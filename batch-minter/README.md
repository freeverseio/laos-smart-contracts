# A contract to do batch minting interacting with LAOS precompiles

Note that all methods remains in sole control of the owner of the batchMinter contract.

## Contract 1

The contract in `contracts/LaosBatchMinter.sol` simply acts as a proxy for the precompiled contracts except
for the batch mint/evolve methods. It is to be used by:

1. Deploying to LAOS, setting the batchMinter owner to the desired EOA address (or multisig)
2. Setting the owner of a created collection precompile in LAOS to the deployed batchMinter
3. Enabling/Disabling batchMinting in the batchMinter contract

##Â Numerology

First of all, the TX must be sent with a **maxGas = 13M**. Trying 14M already gives an error.

With this contraint, as the tests show, the maximum batch mint is approximately:

```
For assets with URI equal to IPFS addresses (47 letters long, such as `ipfs://QmQeN4qhzPpG6jVqJoXo2e86eHYPbFpKeUkJcTfrA5hJwz`):

...Batch Minting 700 assets with tokenURI of length 53
...num events produced =  700
Gas used for minting: 12434864
Gas used per mint: 17764.091428571428
```

To get some other references, if all NFTs have URI length = 400, we have a gas per mint = 19186, which gives approx 650 mints.


## Install, compile and test

The tests are "integration tests" that run directly on LAOS, because we wanted to avoid mocking the logic of the precompile.

1. install and compile:
```shell
npm ci
./node_modules/.bin/truffle compile
```

2. Create your `.env` file with the private keys of two accounts with enough balance

```shell
$ cat .env
DEPLOYER_MNEMONIC="62.......8692"
SECOND_ACCOUNT_MNEMONIC="3f.......11"
```

3. Execute script that tests it all:
```shell
$ ./node_modules/.bin/truffle exec scripts/test_batch_minting --network sigma
```
